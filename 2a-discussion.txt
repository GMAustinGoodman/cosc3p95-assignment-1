how to run code

The code is written in Javascript and intended to run on Node.js.
To run the code, you need to have Node.js installed on your computer.
Then you can run the code by typing `node 2a.js` in the terminal.

How it works:
The program works by generating a random array of numbers and then sorting them using the bubble sort algorithm.
The randomly generated array is created in such a way that the generated numbers are already sorted. This provides
an expected output for the tests. The sorted arrays are then scrambled to an unsorted state. The unsorted array is then
fed into bubble sort and the result is compared to the expected results (the one that was randomly generated). The input,
expected and actual arrays are written to log files in /2a-logs.

I did not purposefully include a bug in the sort but if there was one, the comparison between the output and the expected array
would detect it.
